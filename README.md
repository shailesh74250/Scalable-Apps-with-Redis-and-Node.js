About
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime-based, scalable platform used to develop web applications and network programs on the server side. It allows web designers to access the backend of their projects while also allowing developers, who are willing to learn JavaScript, a chance to design. There are many frameworks that have popped up in recent years, but what makes Node.js unique is that it opens up a whole new frontier for web development and takes a hybrid approach.

This book will help you get to grips with Node.js and implement the knowledge to build efficient web applications. You start with developing a backend web application followed by a frontend interface, and later on deploy it to the cloud platform. This book takes a holistic approach to server-side programming using Node.js in conjunction with different frameworks and tools.
